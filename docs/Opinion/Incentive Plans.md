# Point System (PTS)

## Our Goal

With the OPINION Point System (PTS), your contributions shape the market and your future incentives:

* Develop your profitable prediction strategies
* Get incentives for quality insights
* Help create the gold standard for prediction data

Your points reflect how you and OPINION succeed together — by providing liquidity, sharpening price discovery, and making markets more efficient. As the platform grows, your contributions will directly influence your share of the future incentives.

Early movers capture the highest multipliers—don’t wait until points get harder to earn.

## How PTS Works

Connection to the Incentives\
Points serve as the primary metric for incentives. While there's no fixed conversion rate, your point possibly determines your proportional share of the incentive distribution directly.

## Program Structure

### Weekly Allocation

* A fixed pool of points distributed weekly—earlier participants typically earn more points per activity as the user base grows over time
* Leaderboards updated every week
* Designed to reward steady, consistent participation

### Scoring Method

* Internal metrics evaluate activity quality
* Public rankings and allocations provide transparency
* Ensures fairness while reducing system gaming

## How to Qualify & Earn

#### Minimum Requirement

* $200 in total trading volume to join the program&#x20;

#### Three Ways to Earn Points on Mainnet

* Limit Orders (Liquidity Provision)
  * The closer your order is to market odds, the larger the size, and the longer it stays open → the more points you earn\
    For example, if the market odds for “Fed cuts rates in December” are 0.20, a limit buy at 0.15 will earn fewer points than one at 0.19, because it contributes less to active price discovery.
  * Orders amount higher than $10 USDT are classified as liquidity provision, rewarding consistent depth
  * Providing liquidity with limit orders typically earns more points than market orders
