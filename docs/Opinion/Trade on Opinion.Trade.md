# Understanding market prices

Prices reflect the probability of an event happening, based on current trading activity.

For example:

In this market **“Will the US FOMC keep the interest rate unchanged?”**, if **‘Yes’** shares are priced at **65c**, that suggests a **65%** chance that the Federal Reserve will **not change** the interest rate. Similarly, if the price of **‘Yes’** shares is **10c**, it indicates only a **10%** probability of no rate change.

You can also express your position through **‘No’** shares. For instance, if **‘No’** shares are priced at **80c**, that suggests an **80%** chance that the FOMC **will change** the interest rate.
# How to profit?

In the previous example, a trader who believes there is a higher than 65% chance that the **US FOMC will keep the interest rate unchanged** could place a limit order to buy **‘Yes’** shares at **65c** each. If the order is successfully filled and the FOMC indeed makes **no change**, those shares will settle at **$1**, resulting in a **35c profit per share**. This equates to a **53.85% return** (35c gain on a 65c cost). Conversely, traders holding **‘No’** shares would lose their investment as those shares would settle at **$0**.

Moreover, after your order is filled, you can buy or sell your shares at any time before the market resolves, you don’t need to wait until the final decision date to realize your gains. For instance, you could have purchased **‘Yes’** shares in a market like *“Will the US FOMC keep the interest rate unchanged?”* for **20c**, and later sold them for **70c** if the market’s expectations shifted—locking in your profit before the event concludes.

After your trade goes through, you'll receive a confirmation notification. Congratulations—you’ve made your first trade on opinion.trade!

Keep in mind, you’re free to sell your position at any point before the market closes, using the current odds.
# Understanding the order book

Understanding the Order Book is crucial for advanced trading. We’ve already discussed market orders, which are executed instantly at the current price. However, if you think the market price is too high, you can also place the limit order as the price you want.

## Limit Orders Explained

Limit orders are executed only when the market matches your chosen price.\
For instance, if you’re willing to buy “no” shares in “Will the US FOMC keep the interest rate unchanged?” for 90c, but the market price is 97.7c, you can place a limit order at 90c and wait for a seller to match your price.

💡Pro Tip: Limit orders can be partially filled as traders meet your price, so your order may not fill all at once.

## Steps to Place a Limit Order

1. In the ‘Buy’ menu, select ‘Limit’ as the order type.
2. Enter your desired price (or the price at which you want to sell).
3. Specify the number of shares you wish to trade at that price.
4. (Optional) Set an expiration date for your order, so it cancels if unfilled within that time frame.
5. Click ‘Confirm Buy for $xxx’.

## Viewing the Order Book

The order book shows all open buy and sell orders in a given market.\
For example, in the market “**US FOMC Interest Rate** **Decision**,” we are viewing the order book for Trump “Yes” shares.

* The Green Side displays the “bid,” which is the highest price buyers are willing to pay for “Yes” shares.
* The Red Side displays the “ask,” which is the lowest price sellers are willing to accept for “Yes” shares.

💡Notice the gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask price. This gap is called the spread.

# Managing open orders

When you have an open order, it will appear in the **Open Orders**.

<figure><img src="https://3843061142-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F6mpelwUCyqVaG8Gn12tl%2Fuploads%2FHO3cpVt33oEmVg3p0n97%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2ef02769-a244-4452-b8df-f7fdb71206bb" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this example, I have an open order to buy $5 Yes shares at 50c. So far, none of the shares from my order have been filled.

To cancel the order, simply click the **× icon on the right** to cancel the order.

If you’d like to view only your active orders, navigate to the ‘Open Orders’ tab.

If you have open orders in multiple markets, it’s easier to manage and monitor them on the “My Portfolio” page.

# Profit & Loss

## What is Profit & Loss (P\&L)?

P\&L (Profit and Loss) shows the potential gains or losses from your open positions. It's a fluctuating figure that adjusts as the current market price of the asset moves relative to your average purchase price. Essentially, it indicates whether your positions are trending toward a profit or a loss at any given moment.

A user's position on opinion.trade represents the total of all completed trades (whether increasing, reducing, or closing) over time. All trading lots, grouped by market, are consolidated into one position to determine the P\&L. The P\&L calculation in the table is based on the difference between the entry price of the position and the current market price (or oracle price, depending on the toggle), multiplied by the position's size. The P\&L can be viewed either in dollars or as a percentage.

<figure><img src="https://3843061142-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F6mpelwUCyqVaG8Gn12tl%2Fuploads%2FNTfrjyelxsJHFYHvVYmt%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=8daa4567-64ae-43b3-9d42-f541c366ba2c" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Unrealised P\&L (uP\&L): r**epresents the potential gains or losses on open positions, based on the current market price compared to your entry price. This value fluctuates as the market changes.

The unrealized profit or loss of your current position, calculated as (Current Value − Total Buy-in Cost), or (Last Price − Avg. Buy-in Price) \* Quantity Held.

# Fees

At Opinion, our goal is to build prediction markets that are liquid, sustainable, and built for accurate price discovery.

Trading fees are one of the tools that help us get there — not just a cost, but a mechanism that shapes healthy market behavior.

By aligning incentives, our model:

* **Rewards traders with conviction**, especially those who take positions with clarity.
* **Reduces noise**, keeping markets reliable.
* **Offers meaningful, growing discounts** to active participants over time.

In other words, fees on Opinion are designed to make your trading **smarter, fairer, and more rewarding — while helping the entire market stay healthy and efficient.**

## Summary

Our schedule is designed to (i) reward liquidity provision, (ii) reflect uncertainty at the mid-price, (iii) allow targeted, programmatic discounts, and (iv) avoid small-ticket edge cases via minimums.

* Charging side: **Fees apply to the taker only**; **makers are not charged**. This holds regardless of buy/sell direction.
* **Fees range from 0% to 2%** — fees increase as market probability approaches 50%
* Minimums. **$5 minimum order** and **$0.5 minimum fee**. We implement a dynamic fallback so extremely small curve fees revert to $0.5.
* Higher fees apply during periods of maximum uncertainty, lower fees when outcomes are more determined
* Discounts stack together for up to **100% fee reduction.** ($0.5 minimum fee still applies)&#x20;
* All fees are denominated in the settlement asset (such as $USDT)
* **Referral.** Invitees receive an additional trading-fee discount; referrers receive incentives equivalent to 5% of the invitees paid fee (see [Referral Program](https://docs.opinion.trade/incentive-plans/referral-program) for details)
* Gas policy: **We cover on-chain match/settle gas for trades**; low-frequency actions have small user-paid gas.

**Key Point: Only Takers Pay Fees**

Fees are charged only when your order executes immediately. What this means for you:

* **Limit orders (makers) usually pay zero fees**. Even when you sign a transaction with fee terms, you pay nothing if your orders rest on the order book
* Market orders (takers) are the only ones that pay fees when they execute instantly
* So if you provide liquidity to the market, you can trade completely **fee-free**

*Note：A maker adds liquidity by placing orders that wait in the book. A taker removes liquidity by executing against existing orders.*

## Technical Details

### How Our Fee Curve Operates

Our fee system incorporates market dynamics to reward strategic timing decisions.

The fee curve adjusts based on market probability at the time of trade execution.

The fee structure ensures pricing accurately reflects actual market conditions and operational costs. The mechanism operates as follows:

**All Trade Types**

* Trades at extreme probabilities (near 0% or 100%): Lower fees due to reduced uncertainty
* Trades at equilibrium (50% probability): Higher fees reflecting maximum uncertainty and peak activity

**Symmetric price curve.** The <mark style="color:$success;">`price × (1 − price)`</mark> shape raises fees near 0.5 (highest uncertainty/matching load) and tapers toward 0/1.

* The normalized shape below illustrates how <mark style="color:$success;">`price × (1 − price)`</mark> peaks at 0.5 and falls toward the edges.

<figure><img src="https://3843061142-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F6mpelwUCyqVaG8Gn12tl%2Fuploads%2Fb1sKcF7Bvg6P36ynsIpZ%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=f8aff284-b969-4395-b0ac-7dfa66f6b648" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Topic-level base coefficient.** Each market (“topic”) sets a <mark style="color:$success;">`topic_rate`</mark> coefficient; consequently, the base fee rate at <mark style="color:$success;">`p=0.5`</mark> is <mark style="color:$success;">`topic_rate × 0.25`</mark>.

* The chart below shows an illustrative taker rate across prices with a sample <mark style="color:$success;">`topic_rate`</mark> and with stacked discounts applied (multiplicatively).

<figure><img src="https://3843061142-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F6mpelwUCyqVaG8Gn12tl%2Fuploads%2FuuCtjBIpUTDByudkrboX%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=3836cd15-bde8-401a-980f-8846304cf01f" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

(Charts are illustrative; program values per market may differ.)

*Note:*

* *Notional means trade price × quantity in the settlement currency.*
* *Fees are assessed per matched fill; orders filled at multiple prices accrue fees linearly across fills.*

### Fee Formula

<mark style="color:$success;">`Effective fee rate = topic_rate × price × (1 − price) × (1 − user_discount) × (1 − transaction_discount) × (1 − user_referral_discount)`</mark>

<mark style="color:$success;">`Fee charged = max(notional × effective fee rate, min fee $0.5)`</mark>

**Discount Structure**

Multiple discount types multiply together:&#x20;

<mark style="color:$success;">`topic_rate`</mark>: selected markets may offer reduced or zero trading fees

<mark style="color:$success;">`user_discount`</mark>: see [VIP Program](https://docs.opinion.trade/incentive-plans/vip-program) for details

<mark style="color:$success;">`transaction_discount`</mark>: limited-time promotional discounts during special campaigns&#x20;

<mark style="color:$success;">`user_referral_discount`</mark>: see [Referral Program](https://docs.opinion.trade/incentive-plans/referral-program) for details

*Note:*&#x20;

* *<mark style="color:$success;">`topic_rate`</mark> is the curve coefficient; thus the base (pre-discount) fee rate at p=0.5 equals <mark style="color:$success;">`topic_rate × 0.25`</mark>*
* ***Notional** means <mark style="color:$success;">`trade price × quantity`</mark> in the settlement assets*
* *Fees are assessed **per matched fill**; orders filled at multiple prices accrue fees linearly across fills.*

### Gas Policy & Operational Safeguards

To make frequent trading smooth, we cover the on-chain gas for trade matches (buy/sell settlement). Other low-frequency actions have small, user-paid gas. We also set thresholds to avoid micro-burn from very small tickets: $5 minimum order, $0.5 minimum fee, $5 minimum withdrawal.  (Subject to change during abnormal network conditions; the UI will reflect the current schedule.)

## FAQ

Q: Why the $0.5 minimum fee?\
A: Two reasons: (1) it protects the platform when gas spikes, and (2) it avoids pathological edge cases when the price curve and discounts would otherwise yield a near-zero fee. We implement it as a dynamic floor rate: if curve\_fee < $0.5, fee becomes $0.5.&#x20;

Q: Are maker fees always zero?\
A: Our policy is taker pays, maker free to incentivize liquidity provision.

Q: Why is the fee higher near price 0.5?\
A: That’s where uncertainty—and matching load—is highest. The symmetric price × (1 − price) curve raises fees at the center and lowers them toward 0 or 1.&#x20;

Q: Do discounts stack?\
A: Yes—multiplicatively: user level × promo × referral. The $0.5 minimum still applies, so stacking can’t “pierce the floor.”

Q: Can I change my referral code later?\
A: No.
