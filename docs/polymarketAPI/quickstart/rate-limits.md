## [​](#how-rate-limiting-works) How Rate Limiting Works

All rate limits are enforced using Cloudflare’s throttling system. When you exceed the maximum configured rate for any endpoint, requests are throttled rather than immediately rejected. This means:

* **Throttling**: Requests over the limit are delayed/queued rather than dropped
* **Burst Allowances**: Some endpoints allow short bursts above the sustained rate
* **Time Windows**: Limits reset based on sliding time windows (e.g., per 10 seconds, per minute)
