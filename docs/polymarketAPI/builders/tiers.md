## [​](#faq) FAQ

How do I know if I'm verified?

Verification is displayed in your [Builder Profile](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder) settings.

What happens if I exceed my daily limit?

Relayer requests beyond your daily limit will be rate-limited and return an error. Consider upgrading to Verified or Partner tier if you’re hitting limits.

Can I get a temporary limit increase?
