## [​](#what-is-a-builder) What is a Builder?

A “builder” is a person, group, or organization that routes orders from their users to Polymarket.
If you’ve created a platform that allows users to trade on Polymarket via your system, this program is for you.

## [​](#program-benefits) Program Benefits

## Relayer Access

All onchain operations are gasless through our relayer

## Order Attribution

Get credited for orders and compete for grants on the Builder Leaderboard

## Fee Share

Earn a share of fees on routed orders

### [​](#relayer-access) Relayer Access

We expose our relayer to builders, providing gasless transactions for users with
Polymarket’s Proxy Wallets deployed via [Relayer Client](/developers/builders/relayer-client).
When transactions are routed through proxy wallets, Polymarket pays all gas fees for:

* Deploying Gnosis Safe Wallets or Custom Proxy (Magic Link users) Wallets
* Token approvals (USDC, outcome tokens)
* CTF operations (split, merge, redeem)
* Order execution (via [CLOB API](/developers/CLOB/introduction))

EOA wallets do not have relayer access. Users trading directly from an EOA pay their own gas fees.

### [​](#trading-attribution) Trading Attribution

Attach custom headers to orders to identify your builder account:

* Orders attributed to your builder account
* Compete on the [Builder Leaderboard](https://builders.polymarket.com/) for grants
* Track performance via the Data API
  + [Leaderboard API](/api-reference/builders/get-aggregated-builder-leaderboard): Get aggregated builder rankings for a time period
  + [Volume API](/api-reference/builders/get-daily-builder-volume-time-series): Get daily time-series volume data for trend analysis
