## [​](#overview) Overview

The Relayer Client routes onchain transactions through Polymarket’s infrastructure, providing gasless transactions for your users. Builder authentication is required to access the relayer.

## Gasless Transactions

Polymarket pays all gas fees

## Wallet Deployment

Deploy Safe or Proxy wallets

## CTF Operations

Split, merge, and redeem positions

---

## [​](#builder-api-credentials) Builder API Credentials

Each builder receives API credentials from their [Builder Profile](/developers/builders/builder-profile):

| Credential | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `key` | Your builder API key identifier |
| `secret` | Secret key for signing requests |
| `passphrase` | Additional authentication passphrase |

**Security Notice**: Your Builder API keys must be kept secure. Never expose them in client-side code.

Python

Copy

```python
npm install @polymarket/builder-relayer-client
```

---

## [​](#relayer-endpoint) Relayer Endpoint

All relayer requests are sent to Polymarket’s relayer service on Polygon:

```python

```

## [​](#signing-methods) Signing Methods

* Remote Signing (Recommended)
* Local Signing

Remote signing keeps your credentials secure on a server you control.**How it works:**

1. Client sends request details to your signing server
2. Your server generates the HMAC signature
3. Client attaches headers and sends to relayer

### [​](#server-implementation) Server Implementation

Your signing server receives request details and returns the authentication headers:

TypeScript

Python

Copy

Ask AI

```python
import { 
  buildHmacSignature, 
  BuilderApiKeyCreds 
} from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

const BUILDER_CREDENTIALS: BuilderApiKeyCreds = {
  key: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY!,
  secret: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_SECRET!,
  passphrase: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE!,
};

// POST /sign - receives { method, path, body } from the client SDK
export async function handleSignRequest(request) {
  const { method, path, body } = await request.json();
  
  const timestamp = Date.now().toString();
  
  const signature = buildHmacSignature(
    BUILDER_CREDENTIALS.secret,
    parseInt(timestamp),
    method,
    path,
    body
  );

  return {
    POLY_BUILDER_SIGNATURE: signature,
    POLY_BUILDER_TIMESTAMP: timestamp,
    POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY: BUILDER_CREDENTIALS.key,
    POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE: BUILDER_CREDENTIALS.passphrase,
  };
}
```

Never commit credentials to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.

### [​](#client-configuration) Client Configuration

Point your client to your signing server:

TypeScript

Python

Copy

Ask AI

```python
import { createWalletClient, http, Hex } from "viem";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { polygon } from "viem/chains";
import { RelayClient } from "@polymarket/builder-relayer-client";
import { BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

// Create wallet
const account = privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as Hex);
const wallet = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: polygon,
  transport: http(process.env.RPC_URL)
});

// Configure remote signing
const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
  remoteBuilderConfig: { 
    url: "https://your-server.com/sign" 
  }
});

const RELAYER_URL = "https://relayer-v2.polymarket.com/";
const CHAIN_ID = 137;

const client = new RelayClient(
  RELAYER_URL,
  CHAIN_ID,
  wallet,
  builderConfig
);
```

Sign locally when your backend handles all transactions.**How it works:**

1. Your system creates transactions on behalf of users
2. Your system uses Builder API credentials locally to add headers
3. Complete signed request is sent directly to the relayer

TypeScript

```python
import { createWalletClient, http, Hex } from "viem";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { polygon } from "viem/chains";
import { RelayClient } from "@polymarket/builder-relayer-client";
import { BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

// Create wallet
const account = privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as Hex);
const wallet = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: polygon,
  transport: http(process.env.RPC_URL)
});

// Configure local signing
const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
  localBuilderCreds: {
    key: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY!,
    secret: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_SECRET!,
    passphrase: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE!
  }
});

const RELAYER_URL = "https://relayer-v2.polymarket.com/";
const CHAIN_ID = 137;

const client = new RelayClient(
  RELAYER_URL,
  CHAIN_ID,
  wallet,
  builderConfig
);
```

Never commit credentials to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.

## [​](#authentication-headers) Authentication Headers

The SDK automatically generates and attaches these headers to each request:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY` | Your builder API key |
| `POLY_BUILDER_TIMESTAMP` | Unix timestamp of signature creation |
| `POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE` | Your builder passphrase |
| `POLY_BUILDER_SIGNATURE` | HMAC signature of the request |

With **local signing**, the SDK constructs and attaches these headers automatically. With **remote signing**, your server must return these headers (see Server Implementation above), and the SDK attaches them to the request.

---

## [​](#wallet-types) Wallet Types

Choose your wallet type before using the relayer:

* Safe Wallets
* Proxy Wallets

Gnosis Safe-based proxy wallets that require explicit deployment before use.

* **Best for:** Most builder integrations
* **Deployment:** Call `client.deploy()` before first transaction
* **Gas fees:** Paid by Polymarket

TypeScript

Python

Copy

Ask AI

```python
const client = new RelayClient(
  "https://relayer-v2.polymarket.com", 
  137,
  eoaSigner, 
  builderConfig, 
  RelayerTxType.SAFE  // Default
);

// Deploy before first use
const response = await client.deploy();
const result = await response.wait();
console.log("Safe Address:", result?.proxyAddress);
```

Custom Polymarket proxy wallets that auto-deploy on first transaction.

* **Used for:** Magic Link users from Polymarket.com
* **Deployment:** Automatic on first transaction
* **Gas fees:** Paid by Polymarket

Wallet Comparison Table

| Feature | Safe Wallets | Proxy Wallets |

## [​](#usage) Usage

### [​](#deploy-a-wallet) Deploy a Wallet

For Safe wallets, deploy before executing transactions:

TypeScript

Python

Copy

Ask AI

```python
const response = await client.deploy();
const result = await response.wait();

if (result) {
  console.log("Safe deployed successfully!");
  console.log("Transaction Hash:", result.transactionHash);
  console.log("Safe Address:", result.proxyAddress);
}
```

### [​](#execute-transactions) Execute Transactions

The `execute` method sends transactions through the relayer. Pass an array of transactions to batch multiple operations in a single call.

TypeScript

Python

Copy

Ask AI

```python
interface Transaction {
  to: string;    // Target contract or wallet address
  data: string;  // Encoded function call (use "0x" for simple transfers)
  value: string; // Amount of MATIC to send (usually "0")
}

const response = await client.execute(transactions, "Description");
const result = await response.wait();

if (result) {
  console.log("Transaction confirmed:", result.transactionHash);
}
```

// Both transactions execute in one call

Batching reduces latency and ensures all transactions succeed or fail together.
