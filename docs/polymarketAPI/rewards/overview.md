## [​](#overview) Overview

By posting resting limit orders, liquidity providers (makers) are automatically eligible for Polymarket’s incentive program. The overall goal of this program is to catalyze a healthy, liquid marketplace. We can further define this as creating incentives that:

* Catalyze liquidity across all markets
* Encourage liquidity throughout a market’s entire lifecycle
* Motivate passive, balanced quoting tight to a market’s mid-point
* Encourages trading activity
* Discourages blatantly exploitative behaviors

This program is heavily inspired by dYdX’s liquidity provider rewards which you can read more about [here](https://www.dydx.foundation/blog/liquidity-provider-rewards). In fact, the incentive methodology is essentially a copy of dYdX’s successful methodology but with some adjustments including specific adaptations for binary contract markets with distinct books, no staking mechanic a slightly modified order utility-relative depth function and reward amounts isolated per market. Rewards are distributed directly to the maker’s addresses daily at midnight UTC.

## [​](#methodology) Methodology

Polymarket liquidity providers will be rewarded based on a formula that rewards participation in markets (complementary consideration!), boosts two-sided depth (single-sided orders still score), and spread (vs. mid-market, adjusted for the size cutoff!). Each market still configure a max spread and min size cutoff within which orders are considered the average of rewards earned is determined by the relative share of each participant’s Qn in market m.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $ | order position scoring function |
| v | max spread from midpoint (in cents) |
| s | spread from size-cutoff-adjusted midpoint |
| b | in-game multiplier |
| m | market |
| m’ | market complement (i.e NO if m = YES) |
| n | trader index |
| u | sample index |
| c | scaling factor (currently 3.0 on all markets) |
| Qne | point total for book one for a sample |
| Qno | point total for book two for a sample |
| Spread% | distance from midpoint (bps or relative) for order n in market m |
| BidSize | share-denominated quantity of bid |
| AskSize | share-denominated quantity of ask |

**Equation 4:**
**Equation 4a:**
If midpoint is in range [0.10,0.90] allow single sided liq to score:
Qmin⁡=max⁡(min⁡(Qone,Qtwo),max⁡(Qone/c,Qtwo/c))Q\_{\min} = \max(\min({Q\_{one}, Q\_{two}}), \max(Q\_{one}/c, Q\_{two}/c))Qmin​=max(min(Qone​,Qtwo​),max(Qone​/c,Qtwo​/c))
**Equation 4b:**
If midpoint is in either range [0,0.10) or (.90,1.0] require liq to be double sided to score:
Qmin⁡=min⁡(Qone,Qtwo)Q\_{\min} = \min({Q\_{one}, Q\_{two}})Qmin​=min(Qone​,Qtwo​)

## [​](#steps) Steps

1. Quadratic scoring rule for an order based on position between the adjusted midpoint and the minimum qualifying spread
2. Calculate first market side score. Assume a trader has the following open orders:
   * 100Q bid on m @0.49 (adjusted midpoint is 0.50 then spread of this order is 0.01 or 1c)
   * 200Q bid on m @0.48
   * 100Q ask on m’ @0.51and assume an adjusted market midpoint of 0.50 and maxSpread config of 3c for both m and m’. Then the trader’s score is:
   Qne=((3−1)3)2⋅100+((3−2)3)2⋅200+((3−1)3)2⋅100Q\_{ne} = \left( \frac{(3-1)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 100 + \left( \frac{(3-2)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 200 + \left( \frac{(3-1)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 100Qne​=(3(3−1)​)2⋅100+(3(3−2)​)2⋅200+(3(3−1)​)2⋅100
   QneQ\_{ne}Qne​ is calculated every minute using random sampling
3. Calculate second market side score. Assume a trader has the following open orders:
   * 100Q bid on m @0.485
   * 100Q bid on m’ @0.48
   * 200Q ask on m’ @0.505and assume an adjusted market midpoint of 0.50 and maxSpread config of 3c for both m and m’. Then the trader’s score is:
   Qno=((3−1.5)3)2⋅100+((3−2)3)2⋅100+((3−.5)3)2⋅200Q\_{no} = \left( \frac{(3-1.5)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 100 + \left( \frac{(3-2)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 100 + \left( \frac{(3-.5)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 200Qno​=(3(3−1.5)​)2⋅100+(3(3−2)​)2⋅100+(3(3−.5)​)2⋅200
   QnoQ\_{no}Qno​ is calculated every minute using random sampling
4. Boosts 2-sided liquidity by taking the minimum of QneQ\_{ne}Qne​ and QnoQ\_{no}Qno​, and rewards 1-side liquidity at a reduced rate (divided by c)
   Calculated every minute
5. QnormalQ\_{normal}Qnormal​ is the QminQ\_{min}Qmin​ of a market maker divided by the sum of all the QminQ\_{min}Qmin​ of other market makers in a given sample
6. QepochQ\_{epoch}Qepoch​ is the sum of all QnormalQ\_{normal}Qnormal​ for a trader in a given epoch
7. QfinalQ\_{final}Qfinal​ normalizes QepochQ\_{epoch}Qepoch​ by dividing it by the sum of all other market maker’s QepochQ\_{epoch}Qepoch​ in a given epoch this value is multiplied by the rewards available for the market to get a trader’s reward

Both min\_incentive\_size and max\_incentive\_spread can be fetched alongside full market objects via both the CLOB API and Markets API. Reward allocations for an epoch can be fetched via the Markets API.
